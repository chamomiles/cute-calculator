# cute-calculator
## My first personal project in JavaScript ðŸ™‚

Full calculator functionality built over a cute image of one.
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication & division
- Percent & square root
- Decimals
- *and the other buttons too!*

### Built with JavaScript
...too much javascript.

Recently I happened upon [this advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/l1ylvv/comment/gk2hgu9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on reddit:
> For anyone still struggling to get used to JavaScript, i suggest you guys try to **hardcode the HTML entirely in JavaScript**.
> Create your website with JavaScript, with document.createElement, and set the styles in JavaScript as well, and append it where you want it to go with document.append().

And I thought it sounded fun so I tried it out. It's definitely an absolute perversion of the separation of concerns. But it did bring me and the document object model closer, so it was worth it.

### Authentic Display
Lights up with a weak green tint when you turn it on.  
And uses a retro calculator font that's blurred just enough to look right.

### Handles Division by Zero
At least as well as a cute calculator could, anyway.

### Won't work until you turn it on
Just like a real calculator!
